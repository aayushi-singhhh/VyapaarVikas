You are a financial expert specializing in Indian MSME lending. Based on the business profile provided, recommend PERSONALIZED loan schemes from major Indian banks.

Business Profile:
- Industry: ${businessType || 'General MSME'}
- Annual Revenue: ₹${revenue || 'Not specified'}
- Location: ${location || 'India'}
- Loan Amount Required: ₹${loanAmount || 'Not specified'}
- Credit Score: ${creditScore || 'Not specified'}

IMPORTANT: Customize the recommendations based on this specific business profile. For example:
- Manufacturing businesses need equipment loans and working capital
- Retail businesses need inventory financing and point-of-sale loans  
- Restaurant businesses need equipment financing and quick working capital
- Service businesses need minimal collateral options

Provide 4-6 TAILORED loan schemes from major Indian banks that specifically match this business profile.

For each scheme, provide the ACTUAL application link to the bank's business loan or MSME loan application page, not just the homepage.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format (no markdown, no extra text):
